Teslatte is both a CLI and a Rust crate for interacting with the Tesla API.

A Tesla API using the `owner-api.teslamotors.com` endpoint as well as parts of the OAuth flow.

Currently, it only supports some the API.

It is fairly trivial to add in new endpoints if you feel like creating a PR. Please let me know if your PR is a massive change before spending a lot of time on it.

## References

Thanks to https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/ for their excellent reference.

Tesla API recently released [API documentation for their "Fleet API"](https://developer.tesla.com/docs/fleet-api) which appears to be similar to the Tesla Owner API.

## CLI

There is a CLI that can be used to interact with the API. Example:

```bash
$ teslatte --help
